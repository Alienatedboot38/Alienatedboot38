- 👋 Hi, I’m Lorenzo Chave
- 👀 I’m interested in software creation to help me design a videogame in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create functions and use them on parallax robots. We can use them to move the robots, detect infrared light, move towards or away from light, use sound to tell te user that the program is running and more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to create small games to help me gain experience.
- 📫 How to reach me with my phone number (916-430-7157) or my email lorenzochavez06@gmail.com.
